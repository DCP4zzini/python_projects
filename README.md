Hi there,

I created this repository to show you how I developed a simple interface between an STM32F3 MCU and my PC through a serial communication.

In an attempt to learn more about Python features, I wrote this script that reads a number of values from a device based on user inputs. After collecting the values, the script exports all the data to a .csv file with a timestamp.

Please feel free to collaborate with any improvements you wish to suggest.
